Welcome to Michael Longstreth's final project of for csx415.

Please set the working directory to the GitHub directory "DataExpansion".

Here is the information to load the project:

library('ProjectTemplate')
load.project()

When loading the project, source data can be found in the data directory ["~/data/].  The config directory ["~/config/""] has a config file that will load the packages that I have used throughout this project.  It is over inclusive as to the packages that are needed.  The data will be munged to get it into a working format for analysis.  Please see the "munge" directory to view the code ["~/munge/"].

Please note, this is not a machine learning project, as I have not completed the Machine Learning course yet, so this is a fairly simple application.  I did however, run through most of the topics covered in the course at a low level.  All of which, including the Formal Problem Statement can be found in the reports directory ["~/reports/"].

All the code, wiht the exception of the munge file, can be found and executed within the RMarkdown files in the reports directory.

The code for the Shiny application that I have develped for this project can be found in the app directory ["/app/"].  To deploy the application, you can use the following URL, which is also included in the README.md file in the deployment directory [`/deploy/]:

Application URL: https://mlongstreth.shinyapps.io/CostEstimator/
